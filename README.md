# MemoryClicks-REACT

## Overview

This is a memory game that tests how well can you remember which Nintendo characters you've clicked on.

### Instructions

1. The application will render different images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

2. The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

5. When complete, the application will be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
